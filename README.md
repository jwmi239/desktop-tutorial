# Welcome to GitHub Desktop!

This is your README. READMEs are where you can communicate what your project is and how to use it.

Jake Miller!

This lab aimed to show us how to use Git, along with GitHub, VS Code, and Arduino. 

Using Git can be extremely useful for several projects, as it allows for easy collaboration and iteration. In particularly, it is great for iterative coding, as former versions of the code can be accessed by all collaborators. For our RC project this semester, I can see how this would be useful when we are all working together to integrate sensors, motors, lights, and music onto one sketch. We can each work independently on one area, have that work accessible in a repository, and pull from each other when troubleshooting to make integration easy.

While my inability to read and follow directions was a hindrance for this lab, I believe having a better understanding of Git will be very beneficial for future projects.
